      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this arithmetic sequence problem. Hmm, first, I need to find the common difference d. The sequence starts with 23 and the sixth term is 3. So, arithmetic sequences have the formula for the nth term: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Let's apply that to the sixth term.\n\nSo, a_6 = a_1 + 5d. We know a_6 is 3 and a_1 is 23. Plugging those in: 3 = 23 + 5d. Let's solve for d. Subtract 23 from both sides: 3 - 23 = 5d => -20 = 5d. Then divide both sides by 5: d = -4. Okay, so the common difference is -4. That should be the answer to part (1).\n\nMoving on to part (2), finding the maximum value of S_n, the sum of the first n terms. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = n/2 * (2a_1 + (n-1)d) or also S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n). Maybe the second formula is easier here once we know when the terms start becoming negative. Because once the terms become negative, adding them will start decreasing the sum. So the maximum sum should occur just before the terms go negative.\n\nAlternatively, we can model S_n as a quadratic function of n and find its maximum. Let's try both approaches. First, let's express S_n using the formula. S_n = n/2 [2*23 + (n-1)(-4)]. Let's simplify that inside the brackets: 46 -4(n-1) = 46 -4n +4 = 50 -4n. So S_n = n/2 (50 -4n) = n*(25 -2n) = 25n -2n\u00b2. So that's a quadratic in terms of n, opening downward (since the coefficient of n\u00b2 is negative). The maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ax\u00b2 + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, a = -2 and b = 25, so n = -25/(2*(-2)) = -25/-4 = 6.25. Since n must be a positive integer, the maximum occurs at n=6 or n=7. Wait, but the vertex is at 6.25, so the maximum value is between n=6 and n=7. Let's compute S_6 and S_7 to see which is larger.\n\nCompute S_6: 6/2 [23 + a_6]. We know a_6 is 3, so S_6 = 3*(23 + 3) = 3*26 = 78.\n\nCompute S_7: 7/2 [23 + a_7]. First, find a_7. Since a_6 is 3 and d=-4, a_7 = 3 + (-4) = -1. So S_7 = 7/2*(23 + (-1)) = 7/2*22 = 7*11 = 77.\n\nSo S_6 is 78 and S_7 is 77, so the maximum S_n is 78 at n=6. Wait, but that seems conflicting with the vertex at 6.25. But since n must be integer, it's correct that the maximum is at n=6. Therefore, the maximum value of S_n is 78. So that's part (2).\n\nFor part (3), when S_n is positive, find the maximum value of n. So we need to find the largest n such that S_n > 0. Let's use the formula for S_n again: S_n = 25n -2n\u00b2 >0. Solve 25n - 2n\u00b2 > 0. Let's factor or solve the quadratic inequality.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite it: -2n\u00b2 +25n >0. Multiply both sides by -1 (remember to reverse the inequality): 2n\u00b2 -25n <0. So 2n\u00b2 -25n <0. Factor: n(2n -25) <0. The product is negative when one factor is positive and the other is negative. Since n is a positive integer, n >0. So for the product to be negative, 2n -25 <0 => n <25/2 => n <12.5. So the inequality holds when 0 <n <12.5. But since n is a positive integer, the maximum n where S_n is positive is 12. Wait, but let's check.\n\nWait, the inequality 2n\u00b2 -25n <0 is equivalent to n(2n -25) <0. So n must be between 0 and 12.5. So the integer values are 1,2,...,12. So the maximum n is 12. But let's verify S_12. Compute S_12: 12/2 [23 + a_12]. First, find a_12. a_1=23, d=-4, so a_12 = 23 +11*(-4)=23 -44 = -21. So S_12 =6*(23 + (-21))=6*2=12. Which is positive. Then S_13: 13/2 [23 +a_13]. a_13 =a_12 +d =-21 -4=-25. So S_13=13/2*(23 -25)=13/2*(-2)= -13. Which is negative. So the maximum n where S_n is positive is 12. Therefore, the answer is 12.\n\nWait, but let me check S_12 again. The formula using the sum formula: S_n =25n -2n\u00b2. For n=12, S_12=25*12 -2*(144)=300 -288=12. Yes, that's correct. So S_12=12>0. S_13=25*13 -2*169=325 -338= -13 <0. So indeed, n=12 is the last term where the sum is positive. Therefore, the answer to part (3) is 12.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n1) Common difference d = -4\n\n2) Maximum sum S_n is 78 at n=6\n\n3) Maximum n where S_n is positive is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n(1) \\boxed{-4}  \n(2) \\boxed{78}  \n(3) \\boxed{12}\n</think>\n\nThe sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with the first term $a_1 = 23$ and the sixth term $a_6 = 3$. \n\n(1) To find the common difference $d$, we use the formula for the $n$-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\nFor the sixth term:\n\\[\na_6 = 23 + 5d = 3\n\\]\nSolving for $d$:\n\\[\n3 = 23 + 5d \\implies -20 = 5d \\implies d = -4\n\\]\nThus, the common difference is \\(\\boxed{-4}\\).\n\n(2) To find the maximum value of the sum \\(S_n\\), we use the sum formula for an arithmetic sequence:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d]\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} [46 + (n-1)(-4)] = \\frac{n}{2} [50 - 4n] = 25n - 2n^2\n\\]\nThis is a quadratic function in $n$ with a maximum at the vertex.
