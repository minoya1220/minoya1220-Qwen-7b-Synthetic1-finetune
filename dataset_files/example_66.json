      "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find an integer n between -90 and 90 degrees such that the sine of n degrees is equal to the sine of 721 degrees. Hmm, let's start by recalling some trigonometric identities or properties related to sine angles. \n\nFirst off, I remember that the sine function has a period of 360 degrees. That means sin \u03b8 = sin (\u03b8 + 360\u00b0k) where k is any integer. But 721 degrees is more than 360, so maybe I can subtract 360 from it to find an equivalent angle. Let me check:\n\n721\u00b0 divided by 360\u00b0 is 2 with a remainder. Let me compute 721 - 2*360. 2*360 is 720, so 721 - 720 is 1 degree. Wait, so sin 721\u00b0 is the same as sin 1\u00b0, right? Because every full rotation (360\u00b0) brings us back to the same sine value. So sin 721\u00b0 = sin (1\u00b0). \n\nBut the problem is asking for an angle n between -90 and 90 degrees with the same sine. Since 1\u00b0 is already within that range (because 1\u00b0 is between -90\u00b0 and 90\u00b0), then n could be 1. But wait, let me make sure. \n\nAnother thing I remember is that sine is also equal to sin(180\u00b0 - \u03b8). So sin \u03b8 = sin(180\u00b0 - \u03b8). But does that apply here? Let's think. If I use that identity, then sin 1\u00b0 = sin(179\u00b0). But 179\u00b0 is outside the range of -90\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, so that's not helpful here. \n\nAlternatively, since sine is an odd function, sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8. But if sin 721\u00b0 = sin 1\u00b0, then sin 1\u00b0 is positive. So sin(-1\u00b0) would be -sin1\u00b0, which is negative. That's not equal to sin1\u00b0, so that's not helpful either. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another angle within -90 to 90 that has the same sine as 1\u00b0. But since 1\u00b0 is already in the range, the answer should be 1\u00b0, right? Because the other angles that have the same sine are either in the first or second quadrant (i.e., 1\u00b0 and 179\u00b0). But 179\u00b0 is not in our desired range. Similarly, if we consider negative angles, maybe there's a negative angle whose sine is the same as sin1\u00b0? \n\nBut sine is positive in the first and second quadrants and negative in the third and fourth. So if we have a negative angle between -90\u00b0 and 0\u00b0, that would be in the fourth quadrant. The sine of an angle in the fourth quadrant is negative. But sin1\u00b0 is positive, so that can't be. Therefore, the only angle in the range -90\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 with the same sine as 1\u00b0 is 1\u00b0 itself. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's think about reference angles. The reference angle for 721\u00b0 is 1\u00b0, as we established. Since 721\u00b0 is in the first quadrant (since after subtracting 2*360\u00b0, we get 1\u00b0, which is in the first quadrant), so sin is positive. Therefore, the sine of 721\u00b0 is equal to sin1\u00b0, and since 1\u00b0 is within the range -90\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, the answer is 1. \n\nBut wait a second, what if there's another angle in that range? For example, maybe another angle that's co-terminal or something? Let me think. If we consider the general solution for sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b1, it's \u03b8 = \u03b1 + 360\u00b0k or \u03b8 = 180\u00b0 - \u03b1 + 360\u00b0k. So in this case, \u03b1 is 1\u00b0, so the solutions would be \u03b8 = 1\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k or \u03b8 = 179\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k. \n\nBut we need \u03b8 to be between -90\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. Let's see what values of k would satisfy that. \n\nFor the first case, \u03b8 = 1\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k. If k=0, \u03b8=1\u00b0, which is within the range. If k=1, \u03b8=361\u00b0, which is outside. If k=-1, \u03b8=1\u00b0 - 360\u00b0= -359\u00b0, which is also outside the range. So the only solution here is 1\u00b0.\n\nFor the second case, \u03b8 = 179\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k. Let's check k=0: \u03b8=179\u00b0, which is outside the upper limit of 90\u00b0. k=-1: 179\u00b0 - 360\u00b0= -181\u00b0, which is below -90\u00b0. So no solutions in this case. \n\nTherefore, the only solution within the given range is 1\u00b0. Therefore, n=1. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"integer n, -90 \u2264 n \u2264 90\", so n=1 is valid. Let me just confirm once again. \n\nWait, another thought: Could there be a negative angle equivalent? For example, using the identity sin\u03b8 = sin(180\u00b0 - \u03b8), but 180\u00b0 - 1\u00b0 = 179\u00b0, which is positive. The negative angle equivalent would require that sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u03b8, which would be -sin1\u00b0, but since sin721\u00b0 is positive, that's not possible. Therefore, no negative angle here would work. \n\nSo yes, the answer must be 1. Therefore, the integer n is 1.\n</think>\n\nTo find the integer \\( n \\) such that \\( \\sin n^\\circ = \\sin 721^\\circ \\) and \\( -90 \\le n \\le 90 \\), we start by simplifying \\( 721^\\circ \\). \n\nSince the sine function has a period of \\( 360^\\circ \\), we subtract \\( 2 \\times 360^\\circ \\) from \\( 721^\\circ \\):\n\\[\n721^\\circ - 2 \\times 360^\\circ = 721^\\circ - 720^\\circ = 1^\\circ\n\\]\nThus, \\( \\sin 721^\\circ = \\sin 1^\\circ \\).\n\nNext, we check if \\( 1^\\circ \\) is within the given range \\( -90 \\le n \\le 90 \\). Since \\( 1^\\circ \\) is within this range, we conclude that \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nConsidering the periodicity and symmetry properties of the sine function, other angles such as \\( 179^\\circ \\) (which is \\( 180^\\circ - 1^\\circ \\)) are outside the range \\( -90 \\le n \\le 90 \\). Negative angles would result in negative sine values, which do not match \\( \\sin 1^\\circ \\).\n\nThus, the integer \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
