      "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. June and Julia live 2 miles apart, and it takes June 8 minutes to bike to Julia's house. Now, I need to figure out how long it would take her to bike 5 miles to Bernard's house at the same rate. Hmm, so this is a rate problem. I think I should start by finding her speed.\n\nSpeed is usually distance divided by time. The distance between June and Julia's houses is 2 miles, and she covers that in 8 minutes. So her speed would be 2 miles divided by 8 minutes. Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 8 is 0.25. So that's 0.25 miles per minute. Wait, is that right? If she goes 2 miles in 8 minutes, then in one minute she goes 2/8 miles, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25 miles per minute. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is asking how long it would take her to ride 5 miles at the same speed. Time is equal to distance divided by speed. So, the time for 5 miles would be 5 miles divided by 0.25 miles per minute. Let me do that division. 5 divided by 0.25. Hmm, dividing by a decimal. Alternatively, I can think of 0.25 as a fraction, which is 1/4. So dividing by 1/4 is the same as multiplying by 4. So 5 times 4 is 20. Therefore, it would take her 20 minutes.\n\nWait, let me check again. If her speed is 0.25 miles per minute, then in one minute she does a quarter mile. So in 4 minutes, she would do 1 mile. Then for 5 miles, that's 4 minutes multiplied by 5, which is 20 minutes. Yep, that checks out. So the answer should be 20 minutes.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The key was to find her speed using the given distance and time, then apply that speed to the new distance. Since the rate is constant, the time should be proportional to the distance. So doubling the distance would double the time, tripling would triple, etc. Since 5 miles is 2.5 times the original 2 miles, but wait, no, 5 isn't a multiple of 2. So maybe better to use the rate formula instead of ratios. But since I did the rate calculation correctly, the answer is 20. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nJune's speed is calculated by dividing the distance she travels by the time taken. She rides 2 miles in 8 minutes, so her speed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\frac{2 \\text{ miles}}{8 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.25 \\text{ miles per minute}\n\\]\n\nTo find the time it takes her to ride 5 miles at the same speed, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{5 \\text{ miles}}{0.25 \\text{ miles per minute}} = 20 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{20}",
