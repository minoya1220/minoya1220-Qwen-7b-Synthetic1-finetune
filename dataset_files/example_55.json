      "content": "<think>Alright, I need to figure out what the output of the stuff function is when given the input \"emVkKntN\". Let me start by understanding the code step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the code structure, there's a bunch of classes: Strategy, ShiftStrategy, ShiftStrategyFactory, Encoder, and EncoderManager. The main function is stuff, which creates an EncoderManager and processes the input string through it.\n\nThe EncoderManager's process method uses the Encoder's encode function. The encode method calls _encodeRecursive, which is a recursive function that processes each character of the string.\n\nLet me focus on the _encodeRecursive method. It seems like it processes each character by applying a shift strategy. The shift value is determined by the index of the character modulo 26. For each index, the shift is index % 26. Then, using the ShiftStrategyFactory, it gets a ShiftStrategy with that shift value. The strategy's apply method is called on the character.\n\nWait, the ShiftStrategy's apply method shifts the character by the given shift. But what's the actual shift here? Let me check.\n\nIn the ShiftStrategy's apply method, the shift used is either the shiftOverride parameter or the instance's shift. In the case of the encoder, when strategy.apply(c) is called, no shiftOverride is provided, so it uses the shift stored in the strategy. The strategy's shift is the normalizedShift from the factory, which is (shift % 26 +26) %26. But since the shift passed to getShiftStrategy is index %26, which is already between 0 and 25, the normalized shift would be the same.\n\nWait, the ShiftStrategyFactory's getShiftStrategy takes a shift, normalizes it to (shift %26 +26) %26, which ensures it's a positive value between 0 and 25. Then, each ShiftStrategy instance is cached per normalized shift.\n\nSo for each character in the input string, the shift applied is equal to its index (starting from 0) modulo 26. Then, each character is shifted by that amount. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, what's the direction of the shift? The ShiftStrategy's apply method calculates effectiveShift as (actualShift %26 +26) %26. Then, shiftedCode is (charCode - base + effectiveShift) mod26 + base. That's a Caesar cipher shift where each character is shifted forward by effectiveShift positions. So if effectiveShift is 1, 'a' becomes 'b', 'z' becomes 'a', etc.\n\nSo for each character in the input, the shift applied is equal to its index (0-based) modulo 26. For example, the first character (index 0) is shifted by 0, so remains the same. The second character (index 1) shifted by 1, etc.\n\nWait, the input string is \"emVkKntN\". Let's index each character:\n\nIndices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nSo for each character:\n\n0: shift 0\n1: shift 1\n2: shift 2\n3: shift 3\n4: shift 4\n5: shift 5\n6: shift 6 (since 6 mod26 is 6)\n7: shift 7\n\nBut wait, the input string \"emVkKntN\" has 8 characters. Let's list each character with their indices:\n\n0: 'e'\n1: 'm'\n2: 'V'\n3: 'k'\n4: 'K'\n5: 'n'\n6: 't'\n7: 'N'\n\nEach of these will be shifted by their index. Let's process each character one by one.\n\nStarting with index 0, shift 0: the character remains the same. So 'e' shifted by 0 is 'e'.\n\nIndex 1, shift 1: 'm' shifted by 1. 'm' is lowercase, so base is 97. 'm' is char code 109. 109 -97 =12. Adding shift 1 gives 13. 13 mod26 is 13. Add base 97 \u2192 110, which is 'n'. So 'm' becomes 'n'.\n\nIndex 2, shift 2: 'V' is uppercase. Base is 65. 'V' is code 86. 86-65=21. 21 + 2 =23. 23 mod26 is 23. 23 +65=88 \u2192 'X'. So 'V' becomes 'X'.\n\nIndex3, shift3: 'k' lowercase. Code is 107. 107-97=10. 10+3=13. 13 mod26 is13 \u2192 13+97=110 \u2192 'n'. So 'k' becomes 'n'.\n\nIndex4, shift4: 'K' uppercase. Code 75. 75-65=10. 10+4=14. 14 mod26=14. 65+14=79 \u2192 'O'. So 'K' becomes 'O'.\n\nIndex5, shift5: 'n' lowercase. Code 110. 110-97=13. 13+5=18. 18 mod26=18. 97+18=115 \u2192 's'. So 'n' becomes 's'.\n\nIndex6, shift6: 't' lowercase. Code 116. 116-97=19. 19+6=25. 25 mod26=25. 97+25=122 \u2192 'z'. So 't' becomes 'z'.\n\nIndex7, shift7: 'N' uppercase. Code 78. 78-65=13. 13+7=20. 20 mod26=20. 65+20=85 \u2192 'U'. So 'N' becomes 'U'.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nOriginal: e m V k K n t N\nIndexes:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nShifts:0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nResult: e n X n O s z U \u2192 \"enXnOszU\"\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step.\n\nFirst character 'e' (index 0, shift 0). So no change. Correct.\n\nSecond character 'm' (index1, shift1). m (109) \u2192 109 +1=110 \u2192 'n'. Correct.\n\nThird character 'V' (index2, shift2). V is code 86. 86 -65=21. 21 +2=23 \u2192 65+23=88 \u2192 'X'. Correct.\n\nFourth character 'k' (index3, shift3). 107-97=10 \u2192 10+3=13 \u2192 97+13=110 \u2192 'n'. Correct.\n\nFifth character 'K' (index4, shift4). 75-65=10 \u2192 10+4=14 \u2192 65+14=79 \u2192 'O'. Correct.\n\nSixth character 'n' (index5, shift5). 110-97=13 \u2192 13+5=18 \u2192 115 \u2192 's'. Correct.\n\nSeventh character 't' (index6, shift6). 116-97=19 \u2192 19+6=25 \u2192 122 \u2192 'z'. Correct.\n\nEighth character 'N' (index7, shift7). 78-65=13 \u2192 13+7=20 \u2192 85 \u2192 'U'. Correct.\n\nSo the transformed string would be 'enXnOszU'.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the code again. The Encoder's _encodeRecursive function uses memoization. Wait, but how does that affect the result?\n\nThe _encodeRecursive function seems to build up the accumulator (acc) with each character processed. The memoization is storing a key based on the index and the accumulator length, and saving the substring after the current position. But since this is a recursive approach, maybe the memoization is trying to avoid redundant computations. However, in this case, the input is \"emVkKntN\" which is processed sequentially, so the memoization might not affect the outcome here. Because each step processes the next character in sequence, and the memoization key is index and acc length, which for a linear processing would not hit any memoized entries except perhaps in cases where the same state is revisited, but given the input is processed once from left to right, perhaps the memoization isn't being used. Let's think again.\n\nThe memoization key is `${index}-${acc.length}`. At each step, the function checks if this key exists in the memoization map. If it does, it appends the memoized result to the current accumulator. However, since the processing is building the accumulator step by step, the acc.length should be equal to index (since each step appends one character). For example, when index is 0, acc is empty, length 0. Then, after pushing the first character, index becomes 1, acc.length is 1. So the key would be like \"0-0\", \"1-1\", etc. Since each step is only processing the next character and pushing it to acc, the memoization might not be triggered here. Because for each step, the key is unique (since index and acc.length are both incrementing). Unless there's a case where the same index and acc length are revisited. But in a normal left-to-right processing without branching, I think each key is unique, so memoization isn't actually storing anything useful here. Wait, but why is the memoization code present then?\n\nLooking at the _encodeRecursive function:\n\nAt each step, after processing the current character, it pushes newChar to acc, then calls _encodeRecursive with index+1 and acc. Then, the result is stored in memoization with the key based on the current index and acc.length (before popping). Wait, but after the recursive call, the code pops the last element of acc. So the acc is being used as a temporary array that's built up and then backtracked. Wait, this seems like a depth-first approach, but in practice, since the code is processing the string left to right, maybe the memoization is not effective. But perhaps there's a reason for this structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this code is supposed to handle possible alternative paths, but in the given input, each step is processed once. Let me try to simulate the processing of the input \"emVkKntN\" step by step.\n\nStarting with index 0, acc is empty.\n\nFirst call to _encodeRecursive(str, 0, []).\n\nCheck if index (0) is equal to str length (8). No.\n\nKey is \"0-0\". Since memoization is empty, proceed.\n\nc is 'e', shift is 0 mod26 \u2192 0.\n\nstrategy is ShiftStrategy with shift 0. apply('e', 0) \u2192 since shift is 0, 'e' remains 'e'.\n\nacc becomes ['e'].\n\nThen call _encodeRecursive(str, 1, ['e']).\n\nAt index 1, acc.length is 1. Key is \"1-1\". No memo.\n\nProcess 'm' with shift 1. Shifted to 'n'. acc becomes ['e','n'].\n\nCall _encodeRecursive(str,2, ['e','n']).\n\nKey \"2-2\". No memo.\n\nProcess 'V' with shift2. Becomes 'X'. acc becomes ['e','n','X'].\n\nCall _encodeRecursive(3, ['e','n','X']).\n\nKey \"3-3\". No memo.\n\nProcess 'k' with shift3. Becomes 'n'. acc is now ['e','n','X','n'].\n\nCall _encodeRecursive(4, acc).\n\nKey \"4-4\". Process 'K' with shift4 \u2192 'O'. acc becomes ['e','n','X','n','O'].\n\nCall _encodeRecursive(5, acc).\n\nKey \"5-5\". Process 'n' with shift5 \u2192 's'. acc is now ['e','n','X','n','O','s'].\n\nCall _encodeRecursive(6, acc).\n\nKey \"6-6\". Process 't' with shift6 \u2192 'z'. acc becomes ['e','n','X','n','O','s','z'].\n\nCall _encodeRecursive(7, acc).\n\nKey \"7-7\". Process 'N' with shift7 \u2192 'U'. acc becomes ['e','n','X','n','O','s','z','U'].\n\nCall _encodeRecursive(8, acc). Now index is 8, which is equal to str length. Return acc.join('') \u2192 \"enXnOszU\".\n\nThen, as we backtrack, the code sets the memoization entries.\n\nFor example, after processing index7, the result is 'U' (the last character). The memoization key is \"7-7\". The result after index7 is the substring from the accumulated length (7) onwards, which is 'U'. So the memoization.set(\"7-7\", 'U').\n\nThen, after popping the last element (but since we're at the base case, the acc is ['e','n','X','n','O','s','z'] and after the recursive call returns, we pop 'z' to backtrack, but since the recursion is finished, this might not affect the final result. Wait, but in the code, after the recursive call returns, the code does:\n\nacc.pop();\n\nBut once the base case is hit (index === str.length), the function returns the joined string. So the popping happens as the recursion unwinds, but the final result is already built. Therefore, the memoization entries are set but not used in this particular case, because each step is processed once.\n\nTherefore, the memoization doesn't affect the processing of this input. So the output should be 'enXnOszU'.\n\nWait, but let me check again the code for the memoization part.\n\nIn the _encodeRecursive function:\n\nif (this.memoization.has(key)) {\n    return this.memoization.get(key) + str.substring(index);\n}\n\nBut in our case, for each index, the key is index-acc.length. Since we start with acc as empty, for index 0, key is 0-0. Then, after pushing the first character, the next step is index 1, acc length 1. So key is 1-1. For each step, the key is index-acc.length, which is 0-0, 1-1, etc. Since each step is processed in order and the acc length is equal to the index, these keys are unique. Therefore, the memoization check will never hit, because each key is only encountered once. So the memoization code is essentially not used here, and the function proceeds normally, processing each character in sequence. Therefore, the output is the same as what I calculated earlier: 'enXnOszU'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be \"enXnOszU\".\n</think>\n\n{\"output\": \"enXnOszU\"}",
